## What next?

In this project, you have:
+ Picked `random`{:class="block3operators"} numbers to change the **Plastic** and **Fish** sprites' costumes
+ Learned how to generate and delete `clones`{:class="block3control"} so that they appear to fall away
+ Used randomisation to create complexity in the game

If you have been following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/environment) projects, then try out the project [Tree life simulator](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/tree-life-simulator).
