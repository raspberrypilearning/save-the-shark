## Introduction

Use Scratch to create a game and save the shark! Explore sharks' favourite food source (fish, not humans!) as well as the impact of plastic in the water — harming sharks in their natural ocean habitat.

This game engages with two of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals: [Life below Water](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html) {:target="\_blank"} and [Responsible consumption and production](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html){:target="\_blank"} .
